"Who Asked"

While arguing, you've definitely heard this dreadful phrase come up again and again. "Who Asked, I didn't, Nobody asked" When you hear it you can already tell there is something fundamentally wrong with this phrase, however when it is said, your brain goes into full shutdown mode. This is because it is so wrong and nonsensical that your brain does not know how to react. But by not speaking you have let the speaker win. The audience just goes into mass hysteria against you and ridiculing you. When you really think about it, the word makes zero sense. Nobody asked them "Who, Who asked" That didn't stop "edgy" 12-14 year-olds from using it in every mild disagreement. This is a shame, because the goal of an argument is to come into agreement and both learn things from it. "Who asked" is horrible, because it may hide important points from the sayer. Instead they hide behind the phrase. Sadly in the current political and socio landscape on the internet it is encouraged. And I know that nobody is going to bother reading this whole thing and is just gonna reply "Who asked" because ya'll are the most immature POS's of all time.
