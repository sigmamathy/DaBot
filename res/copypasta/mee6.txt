MEE6

I have severe trauma after a "bot" pinged me on the website "discord". every night I am unable to sleep due to what "mee6" did to me. ill never forget that name. It burned into my memory and ill never be able to heal mentally and physically and will be like this for the rest of my life. the thing is I'm not sure how long the "rest of my life" will be because I constantly am afraid of mee6 pinging me once again somehow and me getting a notification and having to go thru all this trauma again, which I'm still going thru. god, help and heal my brothers and sisters that also have suffered from mee6 and others like bots pinging them and notifying them and showing a little red dot virtually. I need whatever god to heal me because after getting pinged I was having sweaty palms, an increased heartbeat, and now lightheaded and I think I have severe autism and wheelchair syndrome now.
